#  About:
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital cash/digital money that uses strong encryption to protect financial transactions, regulate the manufacture of extra units, and verify asset transfers in today's world. 
Keeping this in mind, We built our auction website and we'll be transacting with cryptocurrency. 

# Tools:
We will be making use of Tezos as it  uses the more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake model to validate transactions and keep the network secure , along with all the languages and tools required to build a  website. 

# Features:
This website will help users  sell or bid for antique products  via the Internet which  facilitates online activities between buyers and sellers in different locations or geographical areas with ease.
